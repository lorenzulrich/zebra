## Why?

* Neos is a great CMS with flexible content structures and focus on a streamlined editing experience
* Next.js offers a great developer experience and a way to build modern websites and applications with a mixed form of static and dynamic pages

So why not combine the best of both worlds?

Our question was: Can we retain the editing experience of Neos while using Next.js for the frontend? And the answer is: Yes, we can!

## Installation

See our demo project for a working example.

TODO Publish demo project ;)

## Configuration

### Environment variables

* `NEOS_BASE_URL`: The base URL of your Neos installation

## How does it work?

This package is used inside a Next.js project that uses Neos CMS for rendering of content and editing with full preview capabilities. It provides components and hooks to handle the rendering of nodes and adding editing metadata for the Neos UI.

Inside Neos CMS a few supporting packages are used to provide the necessary data for the frontend and change the behavior of the Neos UI:

* [Networkteam.Neos.ContentApi](https://github.com/networkteam/Networkteam.Neos.ContentApi) for providing the content via a JSON API
* [Networkteam.Neos.Next](https://github.com/networkteam/Networkteam.Neos.Next) for integrating Next.js for preview of nodes and handle revalidation of generated content on publishing

### Static site generation

<details>
  <summary>This is how the public view of the Next.js site is generated from content in Neos.</summary>

  Your Next.js project defines a [dynamic catch all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-routes) that will generate pages for document nodes in Neos CMS. The route is defined in `pages/[[...slug]].tsx`.

  Next.js will fetch a list of all document nodes from Neos via the Content API in `getStaticProps` for the `[[...slug]]` route.

  The `getStaticProps` function will then be called for each page with the `path` and `locale` as params.
  The data for the page will be fetched via the Content API in Neos by the path and locale.
  This data is the input for rendering the page, so the response of the Content API needs to contain all needed information like menu items, shared content in e.g. a footer and the content of the page itself.

  For this to work, the Neos base URL has to be known to Next.js via the `NEOS_BASE_URL` environment variable.
</details>

### Content editing in Neos UI

<details>
  <summary>This is how we the the Next.js frontend is used inside the Neos UI content module with full preview and editing capabilities.</summary>

  Now it get's a little trickier:

  You always access Neos CMS via your Next.js site by appending `/neos`, as usual.
  The `withZebra` config helper adds the necessary rewrites to the Next.js configuration in `next.config.js` to make this work.
  Next.js serves a custom `/neos/preview` route that is used to render the preview of a workspace version of a document node.
  It forwards your Neos session cookie to the Neos backend and fetches the content via the Content API - now with access to the user workspace and much more metadata for use in Neos UI.

  This is not done statically - as it would not allow to access the current request and user session - but on demand via `getServerSideProps`.

  By using the Zebra components and hooks for rendering, all the metadata for the Neos UI is added to the page. Inline editing should just work.

  All other requests to `/neos/*` (except `/neos/previewNode`) are proxied to the Neos backend.
</details>

### Revalidation

<details>
  <summary>This is how incremental static regeneration (ISR) is used if content changes are published in Neos.</summary>

  This is done by the [Networkteam.Neos.Next](https://github.com/networkteam/Networkteam.Neos.Next) package in Neos. It hooks into the publishing signals, collects changed nodes and their closest document nodes and triggers a revalidation of the pages via a Next.js API route (defaults to `/api/revalidate`). A revalidate token is used to prevent unauthorized revalidation requests.

  For this to work, the Next.js base URL has to be known inside Neos.
</details>

### Preview of a single node (out of band rendering)

<details>
  <summary>A special case for previewing the content of a single node for inserting and updating content in Neos UI.</summary>

  We use the Next.js frontend again for previewing the content of a single node.
  To override the default behavior which uses Fusion inside a controller in Neos,
  the [Networkteam.Neos.Next](https://github.com/networkteam/Networkteam.Neos.Next)
  package provides a Fusion prototype that renders the content of a node via the Next.js frontend. A single Fusion path is used by Zebra in the metadata for all nodes to use this special preview implementation.

  For this to work, the Next.js base URL has to be known inside Neos.

## Development

TODO Write about development setup of a Neos / Next project

## Deployment

TODO Write about deployment of a Neos / Next project

## Release a new version

### Pre-releases

To create a pre-release one can push/merge changes to branch `next`. This triggers actions to automatically create a pre-release.
Use `@next` as version in your project package.json to use the current pre-release.

### Releases

1. Merge your branch/changes into `main` branch
2. Bump version in `package.json` with `npm version [<newversion> | major | minor | patch`
3. Push bumped version including new tag to `main` branch with `git push --tags`
4. Create a new release with release notes from newly created tag on github
5. The new release will trigger GitHub Actions that will publish to NPM
